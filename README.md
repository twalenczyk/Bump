# Bump [ARCHIVED: 02/23/18]

### NPM Dependencies
* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/intro/)
* [React Native Modal](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal)

### Temporary Login
I've wired up the login screen to work locally until one of us can get things working with the server:
* Username: Armaan \\ Password: admin
* Username: Jack \\ Password: admin

### Design Principles
There are none so far, really. Everything is subject to the change. Just be consistent and logical! Don't use inline styling for anything other than testing a look. Put all styles in the styles.js file in the relative folder.
